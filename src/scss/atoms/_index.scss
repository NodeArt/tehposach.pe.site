// Atoms
//
// If atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, then the atoms of
// our interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that
// comprise all our user interfaces. Therefore these atoms would include
// basic HTML tags like form labels, inputs, buttons, and other elements
// that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.
